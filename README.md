# DFESW3_FINAL
Final project for QA Academy


o	Why are we doing this?
I am making this project to test my knowledge and capabilities following a few weeks of Java and SpringBoot training.
I would like to create this project, a language revision app with CRUD functionality, to pursue a project type that 
I would be interested in. The app should allow users to upload words to a database, and call upon words randomly (or words
with priority) to revise a set at a time. 

o	How I expected the challenge to go.
o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
o	Link to Jira Board - You must add Ed as collaborators on your Jira board.
