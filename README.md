# DFESW3_FINAL
Final project for QA Academy


<p><b>o	Why are we doing this?</b></p>
<p>I am making this project to test my knowledge and capabilities following a few weeks of Java and SpringBoot training.
I would like to create this project, a language revision app with CRUD functionality, to pursue a project type that 
I would be interested in. The app should allow users to upload words to a database, and call upon words randomly (or words
with priority) to revise a set at a time. 

<p>o	How I expected the challenge to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.</p>
<p></p>
<p>o	Link to Jira Board - You must add Ed as collaborators on your Jira board.</p>
